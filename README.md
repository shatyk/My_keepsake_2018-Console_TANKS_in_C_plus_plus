When I learned the basics of C++, I was eager to solidify my skills.
Back then, I didnâ€™t even know that principles like SOLID existed.
The entire source code looks terrible and comical, but it works!

Each enemy tank (of which there can be a maximum of 4 at the same time) has its own unique behavior. This was inspired by the game Pac-Man, where each ghost also has a specific behavior.
The game features 10 consecutive levels, a progressive tank upgrade system, and the ability to play with two players.

P.S. To ensure the game runs correctly, the console window needs to be enlarged before launching it.
